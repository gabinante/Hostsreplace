# Hostsreplace
We have an application that makes really stupid queries and takes forever to respond, but compliance dictates that we have it behind cloudfront (easiest way to geo-gate the application.) Unfortunately, cloudfront timeouts are static so certain pages just wonâ€™t load via the regular web interface. This script is designed to circumvent cloudfront by continually refreshing your hosts file with the dynamic IP of the cloudfront host.
